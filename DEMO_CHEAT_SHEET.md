## 💡 JUDGE QUESTIONS - QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: "What's novel about this?"**  
A: "Three things: 1) True agentic system where agents work autonomously, 2) Self-validation - AI checks its own work, 3) Conversational interface that maintains context."

**Q: "How does the multi-agent system work?"**  
A: "Five agents: Planning analyzes the profile, Search queries our vector database, Analysis ranks results, Explanation generates reasoning with GPT, and Validation runs 5 quality checks."

**Q: "What if the API fails?"**  
A: "We built a hybrid system - it uses AI when available but has smart template responses as fallback. All Phase 2-3 features work without API."

**Q: "How does it scale?"**  
A: "Vector database scales to thousands of courses, agents run in parallel where possible, and we cache embeddings for speed."

**Q: "What's the tech stack?"**  
A: "Python backend with ChromaDB for vector storage, sentence-transformers for embeddings, OpenAI for LLM, Streamlit for UI, all orchestrated through our multi-agent system."

**Q: "Why is this useful?"**  
A: "BYU has 40% undecided first-years. This helps them explore strategically by finding versatile courses that apply to multiple majors, keeping their options open."
