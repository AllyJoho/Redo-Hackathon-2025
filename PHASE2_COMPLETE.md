## 🔑 ABOUT YOUR API KEY:

The API key in your `config.py` needs to be updated. Here's how:

1. **Get your key from Bitwarden**
2. **Open `config.py`**
3. **Replace line 11:**
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "paste-your-key-here"
   ```
4. **Save and restart the app**

The validation features work WITHOUT the API key, but explanations will be better WITH it!

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS:

1. ✅ Update API key in `config.py` (if you want GPT features)
2. ✅ Run `streamlit run streamlit_ui_phase2.py`
3. ✅ Test with different student profiles
4. ✅ Practice your demo
5. ✅ Take screenshots
6. ✅ **Win the hackathon!** 🏆
